    "Why is it important to handle missing values in dataset?\n",
    "Many machine learning algorithms fail if the dataset contains missing values. However, algorithms like K-nearest and Naive Bayes support data with missing values. You may end up building a biased machine learning model, leading to incorrect results if the missing values are not handled properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are missing values in dataset?\n",
    "Missing data, or missing values, occur when you don't have data stored for certain variables or participants. Data can go missing due to incomplete data entry, equipment malfunctions, lost files, and many other reasons. In any dataset, there are usually some missing data\n",
    "\n",
    "What algorithms can handle missing values?\n",
    "Other algorithms that natively support missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "k-NN and Random Forest algorithms can also support missing values. the k-NN algorithm considers the missing values by taking the majority of the K nearest values"

    "It is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is not balanced. There are 768 observations with 8 input variables and 1 output variable. The variable names are as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    ": Imbalanced data set will lead algorithms to get good results by returning the majority. That will be a problem if you are interested in the minority more. So, balancing is a way to force the algorithm to give more weight to the minority."
